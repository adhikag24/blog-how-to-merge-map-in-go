# Merging Maps in Go
In Go, it's common to work with maps, which are key-value data structures. Sometimes you might need to merge two maps together, and Go provides a simple way to do this. In this blog post, we'll take a look at how to merge two maps in Go.

## Using the Built-in "range" Keyword
The easiest way to merge two maps in Go is to use the built-in ```range``` keyword to iterate over the key-value pairs of one map, and then use the ```map[key] = value``` syntax to add each pair to the other map. Here is an example function that demonstrates this:

```
func MergeMaps(m1, m2 map[string]int) map[string]int {
    for key, value := range m1 {
        m2[key] = value
    }
    return m2
}
```
In this example, the function takes in two maps, m1 and m2, both of which have string keys and int values. The function uses a for loop with the range keyword to iterate over the key-value pairs of m1. For each pair, it adds the key and value to m2 using the m2[key] = value syntax. Finally, it returns the modified m2 map.

## Merging Maps with map[string]interface{}
If you want to merge two maps with different types of values, you can use a map with the string keys and interface{} values.

```
func MergeMaps(m1, m2 map[string]interface{}) map[string]interface{} {
    for key, value := range m1 {
        m2[key] = value
    }
    return m2
}
```
This function will work with any type of maps, that have the same key type, in this example key type is string.


Conclusion
Merging maps in Go is a simple task that can be accomplished using the built-in "range" keyword. By iterating over the key-value pairs of one map and adding them to the other map, you can easily merge two maps together. Whether you're working with maps that have the same value type or different value types, Go provides a way to merge them.
